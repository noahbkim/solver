# Puzzle: A Michigan Adventure
# Author: Jax2 
#
# 5 couples met their first day on Mackinac Island in Michigan's Upper
# Peninsula. They all got along wonderfully and decided to spend part of their
# vacation together.
#
# On the second to last day each couple decided to spend the day alone. They
# agreed they would meet to discuss their day at dinner. 
#
# Your task is to determine which two people are a couple, what they did for 
# the day, and what souvenir they brought to dinner to show the others.
#
# 1. The couple who toured the fort didn't buy the chocolate fudge but loved 
#    what Alex and Alyssa Frost bought.
#
# 2. Jack's horse almost threw him off, but he and his wife still managed to 
#    have a good time! Peter, who isn't married to Tracy, wanted to go sight 
#    seeing with Alex but he went kayaking with his wife instead.
#
# 3. Of the five couples, there are: Mr. and Mrs. Hartford, the couple who 
#    bought the fudge, Jodie Smothers, Alex, and the couple who went horseback 
#    riding.
#
# 4. Allen is not Tracy's husband and Alice is not Marks's wife. Mark didn't 
#    rent a bicycle built for two.
#
# 5. The couple who went site seeing bought a beautiful model lighthouse at one
#    of the local gift shops. The Lighthouse and Suzy's model ship were voted 
#    the best of the souvenirs.
#
# 6. Mark, who is not married to Jodie, liked the maple syrup that Jack bought.
#    Allen bought the postcards.
