# Puzzle: Weekend Carnival
# Author: Shelly Hazard
#
# This past weekend the carnival was in town! Greg and four of his friends
# spent Saturday enjoying the carnival. They spent the day riding the
# carnival rides until they were sick and spending their allowance money on
# the midway games. Each friend went home with a giant-sized stuffed
# animal, full stomachs, and lots of happy memories. Determine the name of
# each boy, each one’s favorite game and ride, and what giant-sized stuffed
# animal each boy won.
#
# 1. One boy won a giant lion at the Gone Fishing game, but it wasn’t
# Elliot. Ronald, whose last name wasn’t Frost, loved the flume ride but he
# didn’t win the giant giraffe.
#
# 2. Dave Granger didn’t win the giant tiger. The Fascination game was
# loved by the boy whose last name was Mann. Greg’s last name wasn’t Times. 
#
# 3. The roller coaster was Mr. Donnell’s favorite ride, but it wasn’t
# Larry’s. The boy who loved the Penny Toss game won the giant tiger.
#
# 4. The boy whose last name was Mann won the giant dog. Elliot’s last name
# wasn’t Frost. 
#
# 5. The bumper cars were not Larry’s favorite ride. The boy who liked
# Skeeball didn’t win the giant bear. The boy who loved the Whack-a-Mole
# game also loved the carousel.  
#
# 6. The five boys are represented by Elliot, the boy who liked the Penny
# Toss game, the boy who won the giant dog, the boy who liked the tilt-a
# whirl ride, and the boy whose last name was Times.
